## ARMY - project 

### This project was developed as part of Street Of Code Java course

#### Project assignment :
  _Create an army of sildiers with special abilities. Execute commands._

#### Constrains:
  _Have at least 3 types of soldiers_
  
  _Each soldier has a special ability_

  _Have at least 3 differenc commands_

##### The project was focused on polymorphism in Java. I created an abstract class Hero from which other hero classes inherit. 
I created interfaces with commands. Interfaces for classes that will be able to do damage, heal, resurrect and taunt.
I used polymorphism when I created a list of Heroes (armies) and commands were executed as needed.
Then I designed a small simulation where two armies fight each other.
